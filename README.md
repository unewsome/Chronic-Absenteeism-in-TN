# Chronic-Absenteeism-in-TN

__Executive Summary__
Absenteeism is a major concern for most school districts, however it is very difficult to measure, predict, and improve due to so many interacting factors.  However, one factor that influences absenteeism is chronic health conditions.  

This analysis seeks to look at the general health of a community verses the individual impact and health issues of an individual student.  Because health issues can also affect the student's parents, perhaps some health concerns of a community can indirectly affect student achievement by way of chronic absenteeism in schools.

Consequently, according to the Tenneessee Department of Education, chronic absenteeism is defined as missing at least 10 percent of the school year regardless if the absence is excused, unexcused, or due to displinary issues from out - of - school suspension or expulsion.  In addition, "communities" in this investigation are defined by county boundaries.


__Motivation__
As an educator in an urban school district, absenteeism has been a focus of our district improvement plan.


__Data Question__
Question: Is there a connection to public health of a community and quality of education / absentee rates?

Question: Can one make predictions about a communityâ€™s level of chronic absenteeism based on other factors that help define  the community?

Question: Are there prevalent factors that can impact overall chronic absenteeism in a community?
Public Health
Social Factors
Potential Environmental Issues


__Conclusions__
While each county in TN is unique, several factors do seem to have an impact on chronic student absenteeism.  Further investigation, is needed to discover the impact of additional community concerns such as: 1) environmental factors, 2) demographics, and 3) age of absent student.  In addition, expanding the inquiry to include multiple years and other states may prove valuable in finding additional trends in analysis
